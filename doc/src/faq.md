## Why build a kernel with a custom configuration?

Hypervisors are not required to be able to load an
initrd/initramfs. Therefore we start init from a virtio disk which
requires virtio drivers to be built into the kernel statically.

Because we are building our own kernel anyway, we've got the
opportunity of adding more custom configuration that is optimized for common
MicroVM use-cases.

The **microvm.nix** project contains instructions for Github to build
the `microvm-kernel` package every night and push the binary to
Cachix. In order to use that binary cache, try running `nix build
github:astro/microvm.nix#microvm-kernel` and answer the prompts.

## How to centralize logging with journald?

That is possible without even requiring a network transport by just
making the journals available to the host as a share. Because journald
identifies hosts by their `/etc/machine-id`, we propose to use static
content for that file. Add a NixOS module like the following to your
MicroVM configuration:

```nix
environment.etc."machine-id" = {
  mode = "0644";
  text =
    # change this to suit your flake's interface
    self.lib.addresses.machineId.${config.networking.hostName} + "\n";
};

microvm.shares = [ {
  # On the host
  source = "/var/lib/microvms/${config.networking.hostName}/journal";
  # In the MicroVM
  mountPoint = "/var/log/journal";
  tag = "journal";
  proto = "virtiofs";
  socket = "journal.sock";
} ];
```

Last, make the MicroVM journals available to your host. The
`machine-id` must be available.

```nix
systemd.tmpfiles.rules = map (vmHost:
  let
    machineId = self.lib.addresses.machineId.${vmHost};
  in
    # creates a symlink of each MicroVM's journal under the host's /var/log/journal
    "L+ /var/log/journal/${machineId} - - - /var/lib/microvms/${vmHost}/journal/${machineId}"
) (builtins.attrNames self.lib.addresses.machineId);
```

Once your MicroVM's journal data is visible in the
`/var/log/journal/$machineId/` directories, `journalctl` can pick it
up using the `-m`/`--merge` switch.

## Can I build with hypervisors from the host's nixpkgs instead of the MicroVM's?

Yes. This scenario is enabled through the flake's `lib.buildRunner`
function. See the [`nix run
microvm#build-microvm`](https://github.com/astro/microvm.nix/blob/main/pkgs/build-microvm.nix)
script that you will need to customize to fit your deployment scnario.
