# Shares

Persistent file-systems are provided by both volumes and
shares. Volumes are block devices inside the virtual machine, yielding
fast performance but mounted file-systems require exclusive
access. Shares allow mounting an arbitrary directory tree from the
host.

In `microvm.shares` elements the `proto` field allows either of two
values:

- `9p` (default) is built into many VMMs, allowing you to
  quickly share a directory tree

- `virtiofs` requires a separate virtiofsd service which is started as
  a prerequisite when you start MicroVMs through a systemd service
  that comes with the `microvm.nixosModules.host` module.

  If you want to run from the command-line, start `bin/virtiofsd-run`
  separately.

  Expect `virtiofs` to yield better performance over `9p`.

```nix
microvm.shares = [ {
  proto = "virtiofs";
  tag = "home";
  # Source path can be absolute or relative
  # to /var/lib/microvms/$hostName
  source = "home";
  mountPoint = "/home";
} ];
```

<div class="warning">
When sharing a path that is on ZFS with virtiofs, the dataset must
have options
<code>-o xattr=sa -o acltype=posixacl</code>
</div>


## Sharing a host's `/nix/store`

If a share with `source = "/nix/store"` is defined, size and build
time of the stage1 squashfs for `/dev/vda` will be reduced
drastically.

```nix
microvm.shares = [ {
  tag = "ro-store";
  source = "/nix/store";
  mountPoint = "/nix/.ro-store";
} ];
```

## Writable `/nix/store` overlay

An optional writable layer will be mounted if the path
`microvm.writableStoreOverlay` is set. Make sure that the path is
located on a writable filesystem.

**Caveat:** The Linux overlay filesystem is very picky about the
filesystems that can be the upper (writable) layer. 9p/virtiofs shares
don't work currently, so resort to using a volume for that:

```
{ config, ... }:
{
  microvm.writableStoreOverlay = "/nix/.rw-store";

  microvm.volumes = [ {
    image = "nix-store-overlay.img";
    mountPoint = config.microvm.writableStoreOverlay;
    size = 2048;
  } ];
}
```

<div class="warning">
The Nix database will forget all built packages after a
reboot, containing only what is needed for the VM's NixOS
system. Until this has been solved, it is recommended to just delete
and recreate the overlay after MicroVM shutdown or before startup.
