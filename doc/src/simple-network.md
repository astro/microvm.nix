# A simple network setup

While networking infrastructure is out of scope for the **microvm.nix**
flake, here is some guidance for providing the MicroVMs on your NixOS
machine with internet access.

Use this for your local LAN where IP addresses are free and
plentiful. If not, head over to the
[advanced networking](./advanced-network.md) page.

Because we already use systemd for MicroVM startup, let's pick
`systemd-networkd`:
```nix
networking.useNetworkd = true;
```

## A bridge to link TAP interfaces

To make your MicroVM reachable, the host will place its Ethernet port (`eno1`)
on a bridge (`br0`). This bridge will have the MicroVM's TAP interface attached
to it - directly placing the MicroVM on your local network.

Note that the addresses provided below are examples and you must adjust these
for your network settings. Also note that the `eno1` must be attached to the
bridge with the `vm-*` TAP interfaces that you will specify in the MicroVM
definition.

```nix
systemd.network.enable = true;

systemd.network.networks."10-lan" = {
  matchConfig.Name = ["eno1" "vm-*"];
  networkConfig = {
    Bridge = "br0";
  };
};

systemd.network.netdevs."br0" = {
  netdevConfig = {
    Name = "br0";
    Kind = "bridge";
  };
};

systemd.network.networks."10-lan-bridge" = {
  matchConfig.Name = "br0";
  networkConfig = {
    Address = ["192.168.1.2/24" "2001:db8::a/64"];
    Gateway = "192.168.1.1";
    DNS = ["192.168.1.1"];
    IPv6AcceptRA = true;
  };
  linkConfig.RequiredForOnline = "routable";
};
```

Now that the host is configured, you can define a MicroVM to have a static IP
address with:

```nix
microvm = {
  #...add additional MicroVM configuration here
  interfaces = [
    {
      type = "tap";
      id = "vm-test1";
      mac = "02:00:00:00:00:01";
    }
  ];
};

systemd.network.enable = true;

systemd.network.networks."20-lan" = {
  matchConfig.Type = "ether";
  networkConfig = {
    Address = ["192.168.1.3/24" "2001:db8::b/64"];
    Gateway = "192.168.1.1";
    DNS = ["192.168.1.1"];
    IPv6AcceptRA = true;
    DHCP = "no";
  };
};
```

## Docker and systemd-network

If you use the above `systemd.network` bridge config and wish to run
Docker containers inside your microvms using `virtualisation.docker`,
you may need to add the following snippet to stop `systemd-networkd` from
managing the bridged `veth*` interfaces Docker creates for each container.
Without this, network access inside the containers will be broken.

```nix
systemd.network.networks."19-docker" = {
  matchConfig.Name = "veth*";
  linkConfig = {
    Unmanaged = true;
  };
};
```

## Advanced: Improving Performance

If you prioritize network performance over inter-VM communication on
the virtual bridge, have a look into these alternatives:

- Network interfaces with `type = "macvtap"` are supported in
  microvm.nix. While they're technically tap devices, they attach to
  an external Ethernet port, eliminating the `br0` bridge.

- Server Ethernet cards support SR-IOV: setup Virtual Function devices
  for PCI passthru into MicroVMs.
